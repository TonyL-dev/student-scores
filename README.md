# student-scores
This school project involves using different machine learning algorithms such as kNN, and autoencoders to predict whether a student can correctly answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student's previous answers to other questions and other students' responses. Predicting the correctness of students’ answers to as yet unseen diagnostic questions helps estimate the student’s ability level in a personalized education platform.

****MY CONTRIBUTIONS****
1. I wrote all of knn_inmpute_by_item in the knn.py method and I ran the kNN using different values of k* to find the optimal value.
2. I wrote an autoencoder that performs a forward pass and I trained it using different values of k. I also tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate and number of iterations. I plotted how the training and validation objectives changes as a function of epoch. Finally, I implemented L2 regularization. 
3. I implemented a dropout layer to replace L2 regularization with input from my group members.
